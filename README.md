## üß© How I Do my Ting'

- **Automate the mundane.** No one should repeat the same task ad nauseam.
- **MVP ‚â† crappy code.** It‚Äôs a Minimal, Scalable Application built with purpose.
- **There's always another way.** Don‚Äôt waste time on a single, failing approach.
- **Let AI do the boring heavy lifting.** Amplify your expertise‚Äîfocus on what truly matters.
- **But don't let AI steal your thunder.** If you just copy its output, you lose your unique edge.
- **Communicate clearly.** In teams, clarity is everything. Make sure your message is sent and received.
- **Quality Delivery > Deadlines.** When your values are crystal clear, nothing can shake your commitment to excellence.
